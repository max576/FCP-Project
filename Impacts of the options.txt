Things to say when you hover over the options:

Social distancing and facemasks: Although this is the most basic measure, it is one of the most effective at 
inhibiting the spread of disease. However, it may affect people's mental wellbeing as you're unable to hug your loved 
ones and it may affect the economy as shops and restaurants are unlikely to do as well if fewer people are allowed in 
them as they must be spread further apart. 

Pubs closing early: This will significantly affect the economy as there won't be as much revenue coming in to the pubs. 
Also, the average British person won't be too happy about this.

Closing non-essential shops: Shops play a huge role in the country's economy - if they were to close, many people would
lose their jobs and have to go on furlough, and the government would suffer, as would the mental wellbeing of the people
who no longer have a day job, and some independent shops may have to close permanently due to the lack of income. 
However, indoor spaces are a breeding ground for viruses like Covid-19.  

Borders: Although closing the borders will make it much harder for Covid-19 and its new variants to spread to the UK, 
it will have a huge impact on the airline industry. It also stops family and friends who live abroad from seeing each 
other which will affect their wellbeing, as well as stop people from taking nice mental breaks to go on holiday.

Lockdown: A full scale lockdown is the best measure to control the spread of the virus, but would have devastating 
effects both socially and econmically: children won't get their necessary social interactions and their learning will be
affected, people won't get to see their family and friends, which is an integral part of human nature, and won't be able
to go to work; many people would have to work from home or go on furlough, and the government, as well as business 
owners for example would struggle financially, just to name a few.
