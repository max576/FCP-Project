# Thank you for Downloading the COVID SIMULATOR!!#
##################################################

#Unzip Files

# To use the program you will need to have 4 files downloaded from the github repo, Main.py, SCRIPTS, GRAPHICS and PLOTS.

#SCRIPTS contains welcome.py, results.py and help.py which contain functions needed by Main.py to run.

#GRAPHICS contains the images icon.png, virus.png and others to improve the look of the GUI.

#PLOTS should be empty and will contain the plots, death.png and debt.png once the program is run for the first time, (These will be automatically updated after every execution of the program.)

# The only script you will need to open and run is Main.py

# Make sure you have the following modules installed: MatplotLib, Tkinter and PIL.

# Run Main.py

# You're all set!

# How to use the program:
#Once the welcome page window pops up, start the simulator by pressing the "Start!" button. 
#Click the check boxes to select a safety measure (more than one can be selected) and then press the "Next Period" button to advance to the next page. On each new page you should be able to see a graph showing the death toll from Covid-19.
#When the last graph has been shown, press the "Results" button to proceed to the results page where you will see the final graph and a pie chart showing how each previoulsy chosen parameter has contributed to the debt of the economy. 
#To leave the simulator at any point press the "Quit" button or the exit button at the top of the window.
#Your saved plots can be found in the PLOTS folder for future reference.

#Red cross on welcome window takes you to the main window 
#Graph in period 2 produces extra line
